# Pencil Vision: Text-to-Image Generator

Pencil Vision is a small and basic Text-to-Image generator application with basic modification options. It utilizes two text-to-image models, "sdxl-flash" and "sdxl-lightning," via API calls.

## Overview

This application is built using Gradio along with text-to-image models such as "sdxl-flash" from the sd-community and "SDXL-Lightning" via API calls. The code serves as a simple demonstration of how these powerful and fast models can be utilized through API calls (if provided on their model cards) to create something useful for the public.

Pencil Vision is a part of a larger project I am working on. In the meantime, you can test the accuracy and precision of this app using the Gradio public link below. Since the heavy lifting is done via API calls, feel free to share your wonderful ideas on what can be achieved with text-to-image models.

## Features and Ideas

Current features and potential applications include:

1) Custom Book Illustration Generator
2) Virtual Travel Experience Book
3) Fashion Design Assistant

## Tips for Best Results
1) Be Specific and Detailed: The more specific and detailed your prompt, the better the generated image will match your expectations.
2) Inference Steps: Adjust the number of inference steps to control the quality and detail of the generated images.
3) Guidance Scale: The guidance scale influences creativity. A higher scale means the image will be more focused on the prompt.
4) Play around with scales with the same prompt to observe and get better results

## Contributing

Since the core functionality is handled via API calls, we are open to suggestions and contributions. Your ideas and improvements can help enhance the capabilities of text-to-image models. Please feel free to provide feedback or contribute to the project.
